The following has been performed in this analysis: Data Cleaning, Wrangling & Subsetting, Data Merging, Geographical Visualizations in Pythonusing folium, Supervised Machine Learning - Regression using scikit learn, Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering using scikit learn. Geographical visualization was conducted inPython using Folium, unfortunately the file is too big to be uploaded here. Contact me if you would like a copy.

Some of the results have been visualized and reported in the [Tableau storyboard] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ally.raz/viz/TheStateofChildrensEducation2021/StateofChildrensEducation2021).
